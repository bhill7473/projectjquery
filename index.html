  <div class="aboutcontainer">
<div class="aboutSection">

  <p>I am a junior developer that recently graduated from Case Western Reserve's coding boot camp. I am currently pursuing a BS
  in Digital Sciences at Kent State University. I got interested in programming while trying to figure out on my own how the internet works,
  and just playing around with different capabilities computers have. Since then I got serious about really learning how everything works inside, and out.
  This led me to the career path I'm on now. I enjoy web developing because you can turn your ideas into reality, and in a sense your a modern day artist. When I'm not coding I like to workout,
  listen to music, play video games, watch movies, and do pretty much anything outdoors.</p>
